# Sonnet Generator

A simple python script that creates a new Shakespearian sonnet based off the language of his original. Based in part on an intentional misreading of Julian Yates' essay "More Life: Shakespeare's Sonnet Machines," available in [Shakesqueer](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Shakesqueer/)

The randomization algorithm uses Markov chains, and is modified from tommeagher's [Heroku_ebooks](https://github.com/tommeagher/heroku_ebooks)

Note that, at present, a bug in the code is causing some phrases too smush together into long compound words--more James Joyce than Shakespeare. If anyone knows how to fox this, send me a line, or go ahead and make a pull request.

## To Run

Simply run new_sonnet.py in the python enviornment of your choice. It will print a unique new sonnet for you.
