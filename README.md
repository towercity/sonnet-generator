# Sonnet Generator

A simple python-based web-app that generates a new Shakespearian sonnet every time you reload the page. The randomization
algorythm is based off the Markov chain, and is modified from tommeagher's [Heroku_ebooks](https://github.com/tommeagher/heroku_ebooks)

## To-do

* Move the randomization code into the app
* Create 14 lines, store in a sonnets object
* add a random sonnet number to this sonnet as well, starting after the number of Shakey's last sonnet
* (Somehow) import this object into view
